Project Summary : Drowsiness Detection System

A computer vision-based system that detects driver drowsiness by analyzing real-time video input from a webcam. The project uses Python along with image processing and machine learning components (e.g., Haar cascade classifiers or a trained model) to monitor a person’s eye state. When prolonged eye closure or signs of fatigue are detected, the system triggers an alarm to alert the user for safety.
